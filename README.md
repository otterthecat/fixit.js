fixit.js
========

Resolves any issues a page my contain

Requirements
------------

fixit.js requires any relatively recent version of jQuery (say 1.3 and up)

Usage
-----
Since fixit.js has tremendous power, there is a failsafe that prevents the fixing power
from being unleashed - unless you specifically commit to the decision of fixing everything

	$.fixit({
			doFix: true // fixing powers unleashed!
		})
